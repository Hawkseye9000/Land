        <h1>Nature's Gift - Water</h1>
        <p>Water is a valuable natural resource on earth and essential for our life. Learning about the sources of water on earth and various usage it is put to will help us in understanding its importance for the mankind. The availability of good drinking water is a big need of the world population and we must conserve this commodity and use it sparingly.</p>
        <p>Water is one of the most important natural resources on earth for sustaining the human life. It is available to us from rivers, springs, ponds, underground sources for our daily needs from drinking to cleaning. Some of these sources are replenished by annual rains while some are fast depleting which is giving an alarming call for water conservation. Water is available on earth in many forms ranging from ice-capped mountains to mighty seas. Though it appears in abundance a limited portion of it is potable, the rest is to be processed through costly methods to remove the undesired salts and materials.</p>
        <p>Approximately 73% of the earth is water. But fresh and drinkable water is only about 3%. The remaining 70% is undrinkable salty sea and ocean water. Hence the urgent need to protect our drinking water sources from pollution and also to conserve water in our daily lives. Water conservation is the prevention of water wastage and water scarcity. There are different methods to save water:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rain water harvesting is the best and most suitable method.</li>
            <li>Prevent dripping of water from taps and showers. Quickly repair leakage from water pipes.</li>
            <li> Use an irrigation system which uses water efficiently and prevent wasting.</li>
            <li>The water used for washing vegetable, fruits, and dishes should not be wasted. Reuse for watering garden plants and flowers.</li>
        </ol>
